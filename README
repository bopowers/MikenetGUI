Getting started...

First make sure that you have at least Python 2.7 (so far, the GUI has only been tested on version 2.7, 32 and 64 bit.
If you use other versions, be aware there may be undiscovered bugs). You also need the following dependencies:

Pyside
Scipy
Matplotlib
Pydot
Scons (optional -- be sure you have the 'make' command available otherwise)
Graphviz (optional)

Getting the Enthought Canopy distribution is an easy way to knock out all of those dependencies at once (except Graphviz).

Finally, to run simulations you also need the original MikeNet library set up on your system. Even if you already have 
this, you will need to install the version accompanying MikeNetGUI, as IT HAS BEEN MODIFIED for compatibility reasons.**

In your shell or terminal window, cd into the resources directory of this folder, and run the MikeNet installer program.
This will set up the modified version of the MikeNet library. To do this, type the following:

python mikenet_installer.py

Follow the instructions, and then you can use the GUI. To open the GUI, use the cd command in your terminal to make sure 
you are in the MikenetGUI folder. Then type the following command:

./gui.py

This should load the GUI application in a separate Python-owned window. Note, it may be very slow the first time it is
loaded because it has to import a lot of big libraries.

Refer to the Help documentation (in the doc folder) for details and tutorials.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Note: It should be perfectly okay to have both your previous build of MikeNet and this new one side-by-side, as
this one doesn't set or use any environment variables. So they should remain independent. Using your old version
with the GUI is possible. See the documentation for instructions on how to do this.
