tutorial will guide you through the setup of a simple xor simulation.
Steps 10 and above also demonstrate how to use an iterator to explore a
range of values for a single parameter (in this case, random seed).<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br></big><big><small>Screenshots were taken on a machine running Windows 7, so the appearance of the GUI may vary if you are using Linux or Mac.</small></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Step 1: Name the script</big><br>Here we will call it "XOR demo". The script name will be used to help organize the raw data.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
If you execute the same script multiple times, make sure you use a
unique script name each time. If you use the same script name, then any
older data under that name will be overwritten. This warning only
applies to the raw data storage (the actual .c, .h, and output files
generated), and NOT to data stored in a database file, which will not
be overwritten.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor01.png"><br></div><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Create a run</big><br>Under the "Edit Script Timeline" controls, click "Add Run". This creates a new run object in the script timeline.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor02.png"><br></div><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3: Set run properties</big><br>Click
on the newly created run in the timeline. Then click the Run Object tab
that appears at the top. Alternatively, double-clicking the run in the
timeline will automatically navigate to the Run Object tab.<br><br>The
Run Object tab has three sub-tabs: Run Properties, Groups and
Connections, and Events. Start with Run Properties. Here, change the
run name to "XOR".<br>For simplicity, we can simply use the default
values for the other parameters. Note that time ticks must match the
number of ticks specified in the example files. We know our example
file uses 3 ticks, so there is no need to change the time ticks here.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor03.png"><br></div><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4: Add a group</big><br>Switch to the Groups and Connections sub-tab. Here we will define the network architecture by working with an adjacency matrix.<br><br>Two
unconnected groups and a Bias are present by default. We will need a
total of 3 groups, so click "Add Group" to add the third group.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor04.png"><br></div><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5: Set group properties</big><br>We
will set up each group first before creating connections. Click the
group named "newGroup1" (click along either the top or the side--it
doesn't matter). In the Group Properties section below, change the name
to "Input" and the number of units to 2.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 576px; height: 341px;" alt="" src="xor_group1.png"><br></div><br>Do the same for the other groups: "newGroup2" becomes "Hidden" with 10 units, and "newGroup3" becomes "Output" with 1 unit.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 576px; height: 341px;" alt="" src="xor_group2.png"><br></div><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 576px; height: 341px;" alt="" src="xor_group3.png"><br><div style="text-align: left;"><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 6: Connect groups</big><br>Create
connections between the groups. To toggle a connection between source i
and destination j, simply click the rectangle in row i, column j.<br><br>We
can disconnect the connection between Bias and Input, by clicking the
appropriate place in the grid, although removing this connection won't
change the outcome of the simulations, since the Input clamp will
override any bias.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 576px; height: 341px;" alt="" src="xor_group4.png"><br><div style="text-align: left;">If
you have Graphviz installed on your machine, then the "Visualize"
button will be enabled, and you can use this to double-check the
network design. It should display something like this:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 438px; height: 370px;" alt="" src="xor_netwhole.png"><br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 7: Create event</big><br>If
we ran the script at this point, nothing would happen because no
training or test events have been defined. Switch to the Events tab. We
don't need to worry about multiple phases for this simple demo, so
ignore the left-hand side. <br><br>Click "Add Train/Test Event" under
the "defaultPhase timeline" on the right-hand side. The aptly named
event, "newEvent", contains much of the information about training, so
our final step is to set this up. To open the tab for "newEvent", click
it in the timeline, and then click "Edit Selected". Or, alternatively,
double-click the event in the timeline, and it the GUI will
automatically navigate to the event's tab.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor05.png"><br><br><div style="text-align: left;">Just like with the Run Object tab, the Event tab opens to a general "Properties" sub-tab. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor06.png"><br><br><div style="text-align: left;">We already named the script and the run. Do we really need to name this
event too? Not really. But it's good practice using the GUI to come up
with a sensible name for everything. When running more complicated
simulations with multiple events, following a consistent naming
convention will be very helpful. Here, we can just call this event
"train event", or use the default name "newEvent". Either option is
fine.<br><br>Proportion
can be ignored, because we are not using multiple phases. Likewise, we
are not using tests in this demo, so we can ignore "Link to test
set(s)". Since our goal is to train the network, we will set this event
to "Train" mode (the default). <br><br>Now we need some training
parameters. To&nbsp;associate this event with a set of parameters, we
need to "link" it to a training set. However, the dropdown menu is
empty, as there are currently no training sets that we can link to. In
the next step, we have to take a detour and create a training set.<br><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 8: Create and link training set</big><br>Along
the top row of tabs, there is a floating tab at the far right labeled
"Edit Train/Test Sets". Click to open. This will hide the "Run Object"
and "Event" tabs that we were working on, but they are only hidden
temporarily. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor07.png"><br><div style="text-align: left;"><br>We
see that no training sets are defined, so click "New Training Set" to
create one. To open for editing, click "Edit Selected" or double-click
the training set in the box. This will open the training set in its own
window. Unlike the tabs we have been using so far, only one of which
can be open at a time, you can open as many training set windows as you
like. That way, you can compare sets of parameters side-by-side. We
will only be working with one set in this tutorial.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor09.png"><br></div><br>We
are going to make two changes. First, in the "General" category, change
the "Max iterations" parameter to 10,000. Also, click "Example Set" to
locate the file "xor.ex" in the file system (it should be in the folder
MikenetGUI/training_files). Click "Ok" to save the changes.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor11.png"><br><br><div style="text-align: left;">You
can make any other changes that you like. Most of these can be
overriden by the events that use them, and many can be overriden by
using an iterator to explore different values. See the main
documentation for more advanced usage guidelines.<br>&nbsp;<br>To
navigate back to the Event tab, click the Script Object tab on the far
left, and follow the "trail" back to the event (ie., open the run, and
access the event from the "Events" sub-tab of the run).<br><br>When you return to the "Event Properties" tab, you will notice that our event has already been linked to the new training set.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 985px; height: 712px;" alt="" src="xor_13.png"><br></div><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 9: Include groups and connections in event</big><br>MikeNet
is designed to allow sub-networks of large models to be trained
independently. This flexibility is built-in to the GUI: a training or
test event can be carried out on a subnetwork of your choosing. In this
example, we will not use this functionality because we only have three
groups (see Triangle Model Tutorial for a more complex case). However,
we will need to manually tell our event to include ALL groups and
connections. If you happen to omit this step, the GUI will remind you
before trying to run the script.<br><br>Go to the "Isolate Network Components" sub-tab. It will look like this.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor14.png"><br></div><br>Notice
the parallel between this and the "Groups and Connections" adjacency
matrix from the Run Object tab. This matrix, however, cannot be edited
in the same way. It merely reflects the network structure of the run.
In other words, it provides you with a static version of the matrix
containing all <span style="font-style: italic;">available</span>
groups and connections. By default, none of the components are included
in the event. Toggling whether or not a component is included is as
easy as clicking that component.<br><br>Included components display as light blue. Click on all groups and connections, and you will see this.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor15.png"><br><br><div style="text-align: left;">Connections from the Bias to any other group are automatically included if they exist.</div></div><br>At this point, it is a good idea to make sure the work is saved (go to File-&gt;Save Script or use the equivalent of Ctrl+S).<br><br>If you switch back to the Script Object tab, you should see the following. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor16.png"><br><div style="text-align: left;">You can train a single run at this stage by pressing "Start Script" (make sure your preferences are set up first!).<br><br>If you want to use iteration, read on.<br><br><big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 10: Create an iterator</big><br>Adding
an iterator is done in the same way as adding a run. Click "Add
Iterator", and the new iterator will show up at the bottom of the
script timeline.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 908px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="xor17.png"> </div></div></div><br>At
this point, the iterator is not connected to the run in any way. Think
of the iterator as being a container. We want the run to be inside the
container so that anything defined on the iterator is automatically
defined for the run. The method for adding the run to the iterator is
to simply click the run in the timeline and drag it inside of the
iterator.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="height: 714px; width: 956px;" alt="" src="iterdrag.png"><br></div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
